# Formstack_Submission
Hello! My name is Jason Boucouras, and this is my submission for the Formstack Junior Development Project. 

This application was created to submit to Formstack by Jason Boucouras (myself) as part of my job application to be a Junior Software Developer at the Fisher's Formstack location.This application is designed to help cover bands (such as wedding bands) manage the songs in their repertoire. Music is very near and dear to me, and I wanted to make a project I was passionate about. The user can store their documents (song records) using this application. The keys available are Song Name, Artist Name, Tempo in BPM, Key of Song, and Date Last performed.For example, let's say user Kevin Malone is keeping track of all the songs that his wedding band, Scrantonicity, knows. Kevin could enter:The name of the song, who the original artist is, what BPM Kevin's band performs it at, the key Kevin's band performs it in, and when Kevin's band last performed the song. Using this information, Kevin has a good insight on developing Scrantonicity's setlist at their next gig.   

To run this program, you will need:
1. Your own virtual server environment. I used MAMP (I'm on a Mac machine) to let me run the program, but others should work fine as well. 
2. You may have to change the database credentials. All of the MySQL connections in my program are run with the credentials: localhost, root, root, songmanager. 


Please reach out to me if you have any questions, I am happy to explain anything necessary. For my Formstack submission, I have included the requested video showing my code that I'm proud of in the job submission. Above all, thank you for the opportunity to show you my project! I am proud of what I was able to accomplish, but I also gained tons of learning insight that will make the next project I complete even better.
